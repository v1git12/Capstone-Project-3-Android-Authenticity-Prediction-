Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can accurately predict the authenticity of Android apps.\n",

With the increase in the number of mobile apps, the risk of downloading malicious apps has also increased. Malicious apps can steal sensitive user data, perform unwanted actions, and damage the user's device. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can accurately predict the authenticity of Android apps and help users make informed decisions about which apps to download and install on their devices. The challenge is to identify the relevant features that can distinguish between authentic and malicious apps and to train a classification model that can generalize well to new, unseen apps. Additionally, the model should be able to handle the large and dynamic nature of the mobile app ecosystem, where new apps are constantly being developed and released.**\n",

Another plot is placed horizontally at the top of the bivariate graph and it shows the distribution of the independent variable(X). The third plot is placed on the right margin of the bivariate graph with the orientation set to vertical and it shows the distribution of the dependent variable(Y). It is very helpful to have univariate and bivariate plots together in one figure. This is because the univariate analysis focuses on one variable, and the bivariate analysis explores the relationship between two variables and also describes the strength of their relationship. \n",
