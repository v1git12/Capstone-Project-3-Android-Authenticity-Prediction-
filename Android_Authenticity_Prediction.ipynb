        "Android Authenticity Prediction is a machine learning problem that aims to predict whether an Android application (app) is authentic or not. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of mobile apps, and as a result, the risk of downloading malicious apps has also increased. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can accurately predict the authenticity of Android apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification of Android authenticity prediction involves the use of supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. The features used in this classification task include permissions, APIs, and the app's manifest file.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of classifying Android apps involves first collecting data about the apps, including their permissions, APIs, and manifest file. The data is then preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or redundant features. The preprocessed data is then used to train a classification model, which is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",

        "The results of the classification model can be used to help users make informed decisions about which apps to download and install on their devices. Additionally, this model can help app stores identify and remove malicious apps from their platforms, enhancing the overall security of the mobile ecosystem.\n",

With the increase in the number of mobile apps, the risk of downloading malicious apps has also increased. Malicious apps can steal sensitive user data, perform unwanted actions, and damage the user's device. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can accurately predict the authenticity of Android apps and help users make informed decisions about which apps to download and install on their devices. The challenge is to identify the relevant features that can distinguish between authentic and malicious apps and to train a classification model that can generalize well to new, unseen apps. Additionally, the model should be able to handle the large and dynamic nature of the mobile app ecosystem, where new apps are constantly being developed and released.**\n",

It is a type of plot that displays the relationship between a variable and one or more other variables, usually in the form of a bar chart. A bar plot can indicate the differences between groups and makes it easy to compare the same data points across multiple categories.

Another plot is placed horizontally at the top of the bivariate graph and it shows the distribution of the independent variable(X). The third plot is placed on the right margin of the bivariate graph with the orientation set to vertical and it shows the distribution of the dependent variable(Y). It is very helpful to have univariate and bivariate plots together in one figure.

A logistic regression produces a logistic curve, which is limited to values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression models the probability that each input belongs to a particular category. Logistic regression algorithm is used to predict the likelihood of an event occurring. It is based on the assumption that there is some sort of relationship between the input features and the output variable\n",

Finally, We have found the test score accuracy of 0.69. After apply cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning, we have found our accuracy score of test data with **71.85%** which is good."

        "**DECISION TREE** algorithm is a supervised learning approach used for classification and regression tasks. It works by creating a tree-like structure of decisions, where each node in the tree is a decision point. At each decision point, the best feature from the data set is chosen and split into two branches based on the outcome of the split. This process is repeated until the leaf node is reached, at which point the final outcome is determined. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a test data set to ensure that the model is able to predict the correct outcome with a high degree of accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have built a Decision-Tree Classifier model for Android Authenticity Detection. We built the models with criterion entropy with max depth of 25 subtree. These models yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy in both the cases to be 76.03% before cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning, and after accuracy is to be **77.32%**."

        "**RANDOM FOREST** Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses decision tree learning to create an ensemble of multiple decision trees and outputs the class with the most votes. The main benefits of using Random Forest algorithms include that they are simple to implement, easy to use, and require less tuning than other complex algorithms. Random Forest also offers high accuracy and can protect against overfitting by randomizing samples, reducing variance, and increasing generalization of the model. We have found our model accuracy carried out to be Accuracy Score of 84.06. After performing the cross validation and hyper parameter tuning, we have found accuracy to be **85.11%** with precision and recall of 0.90 & 0.87."

It is primarily used for classification tasks and is often successful in particular with a small amount of data. It assumes that the occurrence of a particular feature is independent of the occurrence of other features, which simplifies the calculation of the probability of an event. With the help of this algorithm, we found that our model has accuracy of 62.63% before cross validation and tuning which is absolutly not good. Final accuracy we have got is of **66.94%**.\n"

        "**Gradient boosting** is an approach to machine learning that combines the output of multiple weak learners in order to create a powerful predictive model. The algorithm works by fitting a new regression or classification model to the residual errors of the previous regression or classification model. This process is iterative, with each successive model improving on the last until a certain criteria is met. It is an efficient algorithm which results in a highly accurate predictive model. Gradient boosting can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning problems, such as regression and classification. Here, we are using GBC for a classification problem and this bagging method is giving us quite good result are of 84.50% but before tuning of the parameter. After cross validation and hyper-parameter tuning, we got the total accuracy of **83.91%**\n"

        "**XGBoost**, which stands for extreme gradient boosting, is an algorithm that uses gradient boosting techniques to create highly accurate predictive models. It is a powerful machine learning algorithm often used in supervised learning problems with both classification and regression problems. It focuses on optimizing the performance of a single model and can be used for both regression and classification tasks. It is well known for its high accuracy and speed. The features that make XGBoost perform well are its parallelization capabilities, built-in regularization and optimization of tree construction, as well as its robustness against over-fitting. XGBoost can also be used for feature selection to reduce the dimensionality. \n",
        "\n",
        "We have found some parameters using some available online information for xgboost tuning (you can see our tries in the commented tuning python snippets above), but unfortunately it takes so much time to tune and to produce the final optimal classifier. So here we are considering the above used parameters to be the best tuned parameter for xgboost algorithm, for the accuracy of the model so we found the accuracy of **84.59%** which is quite good. \n",

The algorithm attempts to build a decision boundary such that it is maximally distant from all data points, and this is known as the maximum margin classifier. To build a precise decision boundary, SVMs use kernel functions which map the data points into a higher dimensional space, making it easier to identify a decision boundary which does not need to be linear in the original space. SVMs can also handle non-linear decision boundaries, which is why they are so popular. \n"
