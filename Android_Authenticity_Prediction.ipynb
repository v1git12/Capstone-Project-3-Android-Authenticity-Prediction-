With the increase in the number of mobile apps, the risk of downloading malicious apps has also increased. Malicious apps can steal sensitive user data, perform unwanted actions, and damage the user's device. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can accurately predict the authenticity of Android apps and help users make informed decisions about which apps to download and install on their devices. The challenge is to identify the relevant features that can distinguish between authentic and malicious apps and to train a classification model that can generalize well to new, unseen apps. Additionally, the model should be able to handle the large and dynamic nature of the mobile app ecosystem, where new apps are constantly being developed and released.**\n",
